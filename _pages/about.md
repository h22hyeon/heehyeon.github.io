## Profile

**YOUR NAME** is a PhD Candidate in Machine Learning at **YOUR INSTITUTION**, where they conduct research at the intersection of structural reasoning, interpretability, and robust evaluation methodologies.

Their work focuses on developing principled approaches to understanding and improving machine learning systems through rigorous measurement, faithful explanations, and reproducible evaluation frameworks.

## Research Themes

**Structural reasoning**  
Developing representations that preserve relational and compositional structure, enabling models to reason about complex hierarchical relationships in data.

**Trustworthy ML**  
Designing evaluation protocols for robustness, safety, and failure mode analysis that provide actionable insights for real-world deployment.

**Interpretability**  
Building frameworks for faithful evidence extraction and decision traceability, particularly for graph-based and multimodal models.

## Education
