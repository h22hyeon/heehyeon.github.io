## Executive Summary

I design and evaluate structure-aware learning systems for modern machine learning applications. My approach centers on clear hypotheses, controlled experiments, and reproducible artifacts that advance both theoretical understanding and practical deployment.

**Core competencies:**
- **Research methodology:** hypothesis-driven experimentation with rigorous evaluation protocols
- **Technical depth:** structural reasoning, interpretability, and robust measurement frameworks
- **Practical impact:** reproducible artifacts, open-source tools, and benchmark contributions

## Current Focus

**Safety and robustness evaluation**  
Developing measurement-first pipelines to stress-test multimodal and generative systems under adversarial conditions and distribution shifts.

**Explainability and faithful evidence**  
Building interpretable frameworks for graph-based models that provide traceable decision paths and verifiable evidence.

**Benchmarking and measurement methodology**  
Creating ablation-first evaluation protocols that isolate causal factors and enable reproducible research outcomes.
