## Executive Summary
- **What I do:** structure-aware learning and evaluation for modern ML systems.
- **How I work:** clear hypotheses → controlled experiments → reproducible artifacts.
- **What you will find here:** selected research, publications, and links to code/resources.

## Current Focus
- Safety and robustness evaluation for multimodal / generative systems
- Explainability and faithful evidence for graph-based models
- Benchmarking and measurement methodology (ablation-first)
